spacedust.vim
=============

Attempt to get Spacedust color scheme working properly for VIM. Includes tweaks for CoffeeScript. For JavaScript you probably want [this syntax highlighter](https://github.com/marcelbeumer/javascript-syntax.vim).

The Spacedust color scheme is created by Mikael Hallendal, used his TextMate theme at https://github.com/mhallendal/spacedust-theme to map colors as close as I could.

I used the Molokai vim color scheme file of https://github.com/tomasr/molokai as my boilerplate.
